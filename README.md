My Portfolio on a Webpage containing information about me, a webpage containing pictures of board games and a webpage containing a contact form called About, Portfolio and Contact respectively:

## Getting Started

When you click on the link opening the website, the first thing page you would see is the webpage, it contains information about me the author. To navigate to other pages you can click on the other tabs in the Navbar which will create a new tab just so you don't lose the other page 

## Prerequisites
